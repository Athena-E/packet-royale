The backend is currently not working and the presentation is soon. Help me create implementations that fake the backend functionality. Given that we cannot make this two-player now, can you make the enemy a bot. Each node in the graph should have an assigned 'bandwidth threshold' that has to be met in order to be captured. Technically, we planned for bandwidth streams aka edges and their capacity to be determined by a user's actual network. Simulate this mechanism. As mentioned before, players can meet bandwidth thresholds to capture nodes by directing multiple bandwidth streams at nodes from adjacent already-captured nodes. If the threshold is not met, we plan to implement a 'reflection' action that reflects the bandwidth stream back to the node that sent it, which could potentially destroy it if it is beyond that node's capacity.
